              <h2><u>Coding comrades!</u></h2>
              <p>We know how stressful learning to code is. Come hang in the <u>Think Tank</u> when you need to relax and step away from syntax for a while. Remember, <em>you are learning, and you are growing.</em> Imagine trying to learn French, Spanish, Russian and German all at once.. That's basically what you're doing now. Each language syntax you learn is another part of the puzzle. It's okay to get stressed, but you took this path for a reason; remember that.<br> You <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> get better. Please don't give up! </p>

<ul>
    <li>If you're not making any progress, step away from your computer for a while. Sometimes all it takes to problem solve your code is a fresh pair of eyes.</li>
    <li>Don't bug out when there's a bug in your code. You are still a beginner, you don't have the experience to create perfect code - because perfect code doesn't <em>exist.</em></li>
    <li>Talk with people who have no idea what you're talking about. Often times, simply reiterating the issue out loud in a way that's easily digestible will help more than anything.</li>
